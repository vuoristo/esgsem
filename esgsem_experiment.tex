\section{Introduction}
Dataflow models of computation are well suited for stream processing tasks. There are many kinds of dataflow models but in this experiment the focus is on dynamic dataflow. Dynamic dataflow models have good powers of expression. The dynamic dataflow graphs allow for conditional execution of actors, which can be used for the construction of iterations and many other logic flows in the dataflow graphs. In general the resulting graphs are not statically schedulable. The dynamic scheduling of the actors is left for the dataflow framework.~\cite{risto-semma} In this experiment a program of which high level structure is compatible with dynamic dataflow is implemented using Open Event Machine.

\section{Experiment Construction}
OpenEM is a runtime system for concurrent programming developed by Nokia Solutions and Networks.  An introduction to the OpenEM framework can be found in~\cite{risto-dippa}. In this experiment Canny edge detection algorithm~\cite{canny1986computational} for video streams is implemented using OpenEM~\cite{openemwhite} and vlib~\cite{vlib} by Texas Instruments. The image processing and feature detection functions used in this experiment are provided in vlib. The research platform used was Texas Instruments TMS320C6678 multicore fixed and floating point digital signal processor. To keep things simple input and output are omitted from the experiment. The video stream is uploaded to the device memory using Code Composer Studio tools.

\subsection{Dynamic Dataflow Model}
The dynamic dataflow model corresponding to the system under study is presented in figure~\ref{fig:ddf_model}. In the dataflow graph the canny algorithm is split into two parts. The first part consists of computing the gaussian filter, the x and y gradients and the maximum values of the gradients for the input frame. The first part is computed for all frames. The first part is followed by frame dropping decision that is represented in the figure~\ref{fig:ddf_model} by the \textbf{Random Decision} and \textbf{Drop Frame} actors.

The random decision actor takes the frame number as its input and makes random decision to drop the frame. The probability of dropping the frame is dependent on the frame number and the experiment scheme. The random decision actor is followed by the second part of the canny filter. The second part consists of computation of the hysteresis thresholding and cleaning the output of data used only in the intermediate steps of the algorithm.

\end{figure}

\subsection{OpenEM Implementation of the Program}
In this experiment dynamic dataflow actors are approximately mapped to OpenEM execution objects. In OpenEM there is overhead associated with the communication between the execution objects. The overhead is small compared to the computation of the filters. To keep the system under study simple as simple as possible, the number of independent actors in the OpenEM implementation of the ddf model is less than the number of ddf actors.

Frame numbers are updated in an independent execution object because the frame number is global and has to be accessed atomically. An atomic queue is connected to the frame number updating execution object. Both parts of the canny algorithm reside in their own execution objects and are connected to parallel queues. The actors constituting the random frame dropping are combined with the first part of the canny algorithm. With these modifications the number of execution objects becomes three.

Eight initial events are created and enqueued in the atomic queue before the actual algorithm execution starts. Each event represents the progress of a single complete frame through the algorithm. The events are recycled and sent back to the atomic queue after each frame finishes the second execution object.

\section{Experiments}
The system under study was loaded with two different workloads. In the first workload no frames were dropped throughout the execution of the program. In the second experiment, the frame dropping is initiated after 500 frames have been processed. The frames are dropped randomly with the probability of dropping the frame set to 0.5.

        \label{fig:eo_exp1}
\end{figure}

In the first experiment the algorithm processes close to 1000 frames per second. The core utilization is presented in the figure~\ref{fig:eo_exp1}.

In the second experiment the fps for the part with no frame dropping is close to 1000 and in the frame dropping part it is close to 1300. A local approximation of fps is computed using moving average with window size 10. The resulting plot is presented in figure~\ref{fig:cyc_exp2}. The core utilization in the second experiment is presented in figure~\ref{fig:eo_exp2}.

\section{Conclusion}
Two experiments which investigated the suitability of OpenEM for implementation of dynamic dataflow programs were conducted. In the first experiment a baseline of the system performance was established. In the second experiment dynamic behavior was introduced into the system. In the second experiment it was expected that dropping 50\% of the frames after the first part of the canny algorithm has completed should yield performance increase of roughly 25\% as the algorithm was split in two parts of about the same expected cycle count. The random frame dropping resulted in throughput increase of about 30\% which corresponds to the expected increase well.

In a simple case like this experiment, it seems OpenEM can be used to implement dynamic dataflow programs with good computational efficiency. Thus, should one use OpenEM for such programs becomes more a qualitative than a quantitative question. The ddf model studied in the experiment was very simple. However, even in a simple case like this non-trivial decisions had to be made about the mapping of the actors to the execution objects. In more complex ddf programs the mapping may become complex enough to put the usefulness of using the ddf model in question.
