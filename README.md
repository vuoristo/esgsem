Dynamic Dataflow
================

Abstract
--------
Dynamic dataflow is a model of computation that is well suited for the construction of parallel programs. In dynamic dataflow the program logic is divided into actors that can execute in any order depending only on the data availability. In most dynamic dataflow implementations the actors are stateless, which results in a model of computation that resembles functional programming in many respects.

As the need for high performance parallel computing is growing, dynamic dataflow based frameworks such as TensorFlow have been introduced to make programming parallel programs easier. In this paper an introduction to the dynamic dataflow model of computation is given, the motivation for adoption of the model for parallel computing is explained and example implementations of the model are explored.
