\section{Introduction}
A program following the dataflow model of computation (MoC) consists of a
directed graph with data flowing between the nodes. The data is split into
tokens that are passed between the nodes. Since the execution of the nodes is
asynchronous, the tokens have to be buffered between the nodes. The dataflow MoC
allows for unbounded execution of the model, which means the dataflow program
may be able to execute for a very long time. The possibility of unbounded
execution leads to the problems the different dataflow mocs try to solve. A
dataflow program capable of unbounded execution 1. may have unbounded buffer
growth 2. if there are cycles, the execution may result in a deadlock where
there are not enough tokens to advance the execution. A good introduction on the
dataflow MoCs is given in \cite{lee2015introduction}.

One popular approach to solving these problems is the Synchronous Dataflow
(SDF). In SDF the number of tokens produced and consumed by each actor is fixed.
The SDF MoC guarantees bounded buffers and deadlock-free execution but it is
very constrained. For expressing more complicated programs, models with more
design freedom are needed. \cite{lee2015introduction}

There exists a variety of Dataflow MoCs that extend the concept of Synchronous
Dataflow such as the PiSDF \cite{desnos2013pimm}, which extends SDF expressive
power by defining parameters and interfaces. The resulting PiSDF model can be
expressed as a SDF. We will not look at these extensions of SDF but at the more
generic Dataflow MoCs categorized under Dynamic Dataflow. Dynamic Dataflow does
not refer to a single MoC but is rather an umbrella term under which many MoCs
fall.

\section{Dynamic Dataflow}
In Dynamic Dataflow (DDF) the number of tokens consumed and produced by an actor
in a single firing is not constrained. An actor can produce and consume
different number of tokens in every firing. This freedom improves the expression
power of the model but makes the analysis more difficult. The difficulty is
underlined by the fact that for the most general class of dataflow models that
bounded buffers and deadlocks are not decidable as proved by Buck
\cite{buck1993scheduling}. It is possible to define dynamic dataflow models that
are decidable by introducing limitations on the types of actors and graph
patterns that can be used in the model \cite{bhattacharyya2013handbook,
gao1992well}. However these limitations are most often traded for the increased
expressive power of the models without such limitations
\cite{bhattacharyya2013handbook}.

Bhattacharyya et al. \cite{bhattacharyya2013handbook} describe many examples of
DDF MoCs. One of these examples is the CAL Actor Language (CAL). CAL is used for
example by the MPEG Reconfigurable Video Coding library. Another example use of
Dynamic Dataflow is in the TensorFlow (TF) machine learning library by Google
\cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper}. TF programs are structured as a DDF graph. The
computations in the nodes can be distributed to heterogeneous computing devices
such as CPUs and GPUs. TF provides control flow operators that can be added to
the graph to support conditional execution of parts of the graph and loops.

maybe explain some DDF framework in more detail? \\
what types of problems are commonly solved with DDFs?
